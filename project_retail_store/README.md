# Simple Shop

> This project is a simple example of a retail store operation.

In this example, one can enter data for a list of products as store stock and then shop for those items, adding the products to the cart and buying items.

This project is part of the following [online course](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-de-programacao-em-python-do-basico-ao-avancado/ "Online Course"). It aims to showcase some of the skills I learned throughout the course.

Comments and suggestions are welcome,
Thank you,
