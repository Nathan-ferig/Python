# Math Game

> This project is a simple game involving math operations.

In this game, the player is given a math operation and need to give a solution to it. If the solution is correct, the player scores a point.

At each new operation, the player can set the difficulty level, in order to receive more or less challenging problems.

This project is part of the following [online course](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-de-programacao-em-python-do-basico-ao-avancado/ "Online Course"). It aims to showcase some of the skills I learned throughout the course.

Comments and suggestions are welcome,
Thank you,
